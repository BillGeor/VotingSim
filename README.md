# Cryptography Final Programming Project: Voting Center Simulation
# @author: Vasileios Georgopoulos, Phillip Tham, Fabien Dabies, Danielle Sarafian

# How to Use the Program:

1) There is 60 real-time seconds to make voters and simulate the voting, so you will have to do both of those actions real fast

2) Type '1' when the command line/terminal is expecting an input. This will allow you to create a voting population. Enter in 
the amount of total population that you want and the number of people eligible to vote within that population. This may take a 
minute as the creation of public and private keys takes some time for a large population

3) Next, type '2' when the command line/terminal is expecting another input. This will simulate the voting.

4) Lastly, type '3' when the command line/terminal is expecting another input. This will print the results of the election from the population of voters that you jave jsut created.

5) If you want to quit the program, just type "4" when the command line/terminal is expecting another input.
